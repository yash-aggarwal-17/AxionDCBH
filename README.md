# AxionDCBH

Jupyter project for Direct Collapse Black Holes via Axion decay. Useful physics constants and definitions are given inside the physics/definitions.py, and the main project is run in the AxionDCBH.ipynb.

Variance2.0 holds the value for variance of cosmic density field as a function of mass, and any example files are simply to test out the code.
